# xv6SharedPagesAndSemaphores
Adding the shared memory feature and semaphore synchronisation features on the xv6 OS, along with
some IPC examples.

The files if you would like to test them, should be pasted in a clean xv6 directory
I have only added new files and  default xv6 files that I have changed

If you want to run the consumer/producer example, you must first execute the consumer:
&consumer
&producer
